Self-Driving Cars Using Semantic Segmentation with U-Net Model
Introduction
The rise of autonomous vehicles has revolutionized modern transportation, with semantic segmentation playing a crucial role in enhancing the perception capabilities of self-driving cars. Semantic segmentation enables these cars to accurately distinguish between different elements in the environment, such as roads, vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles, by classifying each pixel in an image.

In this project, I utilized a U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation to segment road scenes, thereby providing self-driving cars with a more detailed understanding of their surroundings. The model was designed to classify each pixel in an image into one of 13 predefined classes, facilitating the creation of a robust perception system for autonomous vehicles.
Methodology
1. Model Architecture
The U-Net architecture used in this project follows an encoder-decoder structure, featuring convolutional and upsampling blocks to capture and recover spatial information effectively.
Conv Block:
The Conv block consists of two convolutional layers followed by batch normalization and Leaky ReLU activation. The dropout probability and max pooling are applied conditionally.
Upsampling Block:
The upsampling block combines feature maps from the encoder with feature maps from the decoder, followed by two convolutional layers.
U-Net Model:
The U-Net model is constructed by stacking downsampling conv blocks, followed by bottleneck layers, and upsampling blocks to recover spatial resolution.
2. Training
The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer and Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function, ensuring pixel-wise classification. The learning rate was set to 0.001, and the model was trained for 20 epochs.
• Learning Rate: 0.001
